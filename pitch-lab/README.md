# Pitch Lab — C++20 DSP research system

**Local offline DSP research laboratory for sound-design-oriented pitch
processing.** This sub-tree is the Pitch Lab DSP system defined by the
architecture. It is NOT the web workbench (repo root) and shares nothing
with it at runtime.

**Current state: IMPLEMENTATION FREEZE — specification + infrastructure
only.** No DSP engine is implemented, and none is faked: the engine registry
(`src/core/engine_registry.cpp`, the single authoritative identity source)
is deliberately empty and a CI test asserts exactly that.

## Authoritative documents (live in the repository root `research/`)

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| `../research/pitch-lab-v0.1-implementation-specification.md` | v0.1 implementation specification (contracts, engines, tests) |
| `../research/pitch-lab-build-and-ci-environment.md` | canonical build/CI environment |
| `../research/pitch-lab-architecture-design.md` | architecture v1.1 (governing DSP structure) |
| `../research/doppler-whip-pitch-research-report.md` | research findings |
| `../research/AI_ASSISTED_SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_OPERATING_PRINCIPLES_v3.0.md` | engineering process framework |

(The architecture's proposed `pitch-lab/docs/` location is satisfied by the
repository root `research/` tree — one canonical location, no duplicates.)

## Build (canonical environment: see the build & CI spec)

```bash
# Canonical (CI): ubuntu-24.04, GCC 13.2.0, CMake 3.31.6 (sha256-pinned), Ninja
cmake -S pitch-lab -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/pitchlab --version && ./build/pitchlab engines
```

Generated outputs land in `pitch-lab/artifacts/` (gitignored, reconstructable
bit-for-bit for deterministic engines — never source of truth).

## Layout (architecture §B.3)

`config/` authoritative defaults · `experiments/` authoritative experiment
+ curve definitions · `assets/corpus/` authoritative inputs · `src/core`
harness + shared primitives · `src/engines/native/` own engines
(implementation phase) · `src/analysis/` C++ metric modules (implementation
phase) · `external/` vendored permissive third-party (empty at freeze) ·
`tests/` C++ tests · `tools/` stand-alone tools (corpus generator,
implementation phase) · `artifacts/` GENERATED (gitignored).
